# Sorting Visualization

This project provides interactive visualizations of various sorting algorithms to help you understand how they work. You can see the sorting algorithms in action and observe their behavior in real-time.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the sorting visualizations [here](https://sorting-visualizer-ochre-two.vercel.app/).

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Interactive animations for the following algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quicksort
  - Heapsort
- **Controls**:
  - **Sort**: Start sorting with the selected algorithm.
  - **Randomize**: Generate a new random array to sort.
  - **Array Size**: Adjust the size of the array to visualize different sorting scenarios.
  - **Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting animations.
- Real-time visualization of sorting processes.
- Easy-to-understand representations of sorting algorithms.

## Technologies

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the sorting algorithms and animations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArnabM10/Sorting-Visualizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Sorting-Visualizer
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```
2. Use the controls to:
   - Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
   - Click **Sort** to start the sorting process.
   - Click **Randomize** to generate a new array to be sorted.
   - Adjust **Array Size** to change the number of elements in the array.
   - Adjust **Speed** to control the sorting animation speed.
3. Observe the visualization of the selected sorting algorithm in action.
4. Interact with the controls to better understand the sorting processes.
